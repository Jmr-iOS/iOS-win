@section 	Notes
	• Shared Music Playlists

	• Periodic statistics and facts reminder, like the speed of light, how long is a light, and why each is or an interesting fact about that. Consider topics, also consider groups where you can share facts of interest

	• Curiosities, things you are curious about and would like to explore. Places, foods, events, you name it, shared in groups and notifications are used to facilitate group explorations

	• Enjoying that place, a means to capture a location or event and share it. Easy to retrieve, by location, peers, dates or any other tags applied. What do you see? When here, in this’s

	•One interesting fact a day, shared with others. Includes ratings and rankings

	• Ridiculous things I’d do someday, for you to record, share and log. Has the unique feature of recommending collaborations, without you specifically requesting or disclosing yourself
